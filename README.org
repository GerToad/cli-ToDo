#+OPTIONS: toc:2

* Introduction
This is a simple and efficient Command Line Interface (CLI) application for managing to-do lists. 
It allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks directly from their terminal.

* Features
- Add tasks to your to-do list.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Edit existing tasks.
- Delete tasks.
- View all tasks in a structured format.

* Requirements
- **Go** (>=1.18)
- **Git** (optional, for cloning the repository)

* Installation
Clone the repository and build the project:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone git@github.com:GerToad/cli-ToDo.git
cd cli-ToDo
go build -o todo
#+END_SRC

The binary will be generated in the current directory as ~todo~. You can move it to a directory in your ~PATH~ for easy access:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mv todo /usr/local/bin/
#+END_SRC

* Usage
Run the ~todo~ command to interact with the CLI tool.
